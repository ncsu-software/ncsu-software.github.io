However, the field of programming lacks a dedicated virtual assistant. Sandeep Kuttal, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science, is taking the lead in software engineering by developing a virtual assistant specifically designed for programmers.Kuttal's exceptional work has earned her the Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award from the National Science Foundation. The grant will support her project on Designing an Interactive Partner to Support Pair Programming. This recognition follows her previous success in securing the Young Investigator Research grant from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. John Hale, the Chairperson of Computer Science, expressed immense pride in Kuttal's achievements and acknowledged the groundbreaking research conducted at The University of Tulsa's Tandy School of Computer Science. He commended Kuttal's well-deserved recognition, highlighting her continuous success and the positive impact it has on the department."
7/7/2023 21:26:00,skuttal@ncsu.edu,https://engineering.utulsa.edu/computer-science-kuttal-young-investigator/,Computer science professor awarded prestigious Young Investigator Award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research,"Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Sandeep Kuttal, has been awarded a $450,000 grant by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) through the Young Investigator Research Program (YIP). Out of over 215 winning research proposals submitted by scientists and engineers, Kuttal was one of the 36 recipients selected from 27 research institutions and businesses. Dean Jim Sorem of the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences (ENS) congratulated Professor Kuttal, acknowledging her exceptional research capabilities and mentorship qualities. He highlighted her interdisciplinary investigations in software engineering and human-computer interactions, predicting groundbreaking advancements in this rapidly evolving field.Kuttal's research program, titled -Supporting Information Foraging by Utilizing Agents' Collective Foraging Behavior; addresses the challenge of optimizing the organization and analysis of vast amounts of fragmented information to produce meaningful and applicable insights for specific goals. She uses the example of intelligence officials in the Department of Defense who struggle to manually sift through numerous sources to gather actionable intelligence.Kuttal's work aims to alleviate the burden on analysts by developing innovative approaches that leverage collective foraging behavior of agents to streamline information processing. This research has the potential to revolutionize the way information is gathered, analyzed, and utilized in various domains, including intelligence gathering and decision-making processes."
7/7/2023 21:26,skuttal@ncsu.edu,https://newsroom.unl.edu/announce/cse/1761/10125,Spotlight on Sandeep Kuttal,"Sandeep Kuttal, a PhD student in computer engineering, is currently working as a research assistant in the ESQuaRed lab within the CSE Department. Her focus is on end user software engineering, a field that combines software engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and Education. The goal is to design and develop environments that incorporate software engineering techniques to assist non-professional programmers in creating higher-quality software.The ESQuaRed lab is highly regarded in the software engineering community and has been recognized for its research work. The professors associated with the lab are successful researchers and excellent mentors, providing students with opportunities to work on cutting-edge software engineering problems.Sandeep originally got involved in the lab through her work with Dr. Rothermel, who introduced her to end user software engineering. Her current project involves providing debugging support to web mashups, aiming to automatically identify and assist with debugging errors in these end user environments. This project is an integral part of her thesis, alongside providing versioning and collaboration support for end users.Throughout her time in the lab, Sandeep has had valuable learning experiences and has had the opportunity to present her research at conferences, interact with renowned researchers, and gain insights into ongoing research worldwide. She is also a member of the EUSES and SCALE research groups, spanning multiple universities.In addition to her current project, Sandeep has worked on prototypes for end users in the mashup domain, specifically in Yahoo! Pipes, focusing on features like backtracking, variation management, testing support, and interactive visualizations. The efficacy and usability of these techniques were validated through user studies, resulting in conference publications and a journal article (currently under submission)."

Sandeep is a professor at the University of Tulsa. Kuttal is offering virtual assistants for programmers in the field of software engineering. She has supported the â€œDesigning an interactive partner to support paid programmingâ€ project that leads to the award. Recently, Kuttal was honoured with Young Investigator Research from the Air Force as well following which she received a Career Award. Kuttal will work on the Alexa-like programming assistants with the help of her Career-supported research offering several insights into the programming carried out and learned. She will expand and analyse her ideas from software engineering, human-computer interaction ideas, and Artificial Intelligence."
7/7/2023 21:26,skuttal@ncsu.edu,https://utulsa.edu/root-causes-digital-trade-offs-publications/,Of root causes and digital trade-offs,"A team of researchers from TU has been awarded Honorable Mention at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems for their paper titled 'Trade-offs for Substituting a Human with an Agent in a Pair Programming Context: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' This recognition is significant as only a small fraction, up to 5%, of submissions receive this honor. The paper was authored by Assistant Professor of Computer Science Sandeep Kuttal and three students: Kate Kwasny, Bali Ong, and Peter Robe. Kwasny and Ong specialize in computer simulation and gaming development, while Robe is pursuing a doctorate in computer science. The team will present their research paper at the virtual CHI conference in May, originally planned to take place in Yokohama, Japan. Additionally, their work will be published in the ACM digital library. Professor Kuttal expressed her gratitude for the collaboration with the exceptional students. Kate and Bali played pivotal roles in data analysis and writing the paper, while Peter contributed his expertise in data analysis. She also acknowledged TU for providing funding opportunities that allowed them to work on exciting research problems recognized by the research community."
